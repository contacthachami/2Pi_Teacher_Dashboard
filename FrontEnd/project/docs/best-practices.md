# Best Practices

## Code Organization

- Component-based architecture
- Separation of concerns (components, contexts, pages)
- Reusable components and hooks

## State Management

- Context API for global state
- Local state for component-specific data
- Persistent storage for important data

## Performance Optimization

- Efficient re-rendering using proper component structure
- Minimizing unnecessary API calls
- Proper use of useEffect dependencies

## Security Considerations

- Token-based authentication
- Secure password handling
- Protected routes for authenticated users only
